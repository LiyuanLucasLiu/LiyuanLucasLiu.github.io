I aim to design **adaptive algorithms** for **Resource-Economical** mechine learning -- with a deeper understanding on the underlying mechanisms, algorithms can **self-adapt to heterogeneous scenarios**, which makes learning more automatic, robust, and thus Resource-Economical.

Three major directions of my research:
- Adapt algorithms to noisy and distant supervision -- alleviate the reliance on gold-standard labels.
- Allow models self-adapt to different problems/applications -- need less manual tuning.
- Automatically capture domain-specific knowledge -- adapt to different domains with less human endeavors.

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>

- Received **more than 3,000 GitHub stars** in total! It is ranked 2,041 among all github users (according to [Gitstar](https://gitstar-ranking.com/LiyuanLucasLiu)). Although I doubt the Gitstar ranking is incomplete and outdated, it is still nice to have such an encouragement <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>.
- [Torch-Scope](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/Torch-Scope) has been downloaded by more than **[32,000 times](https://pepy.tech/project/torch-scope)**. Although this number cannot reflect the actual user number, there must be someone other than myself using this package <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>. 
- Won the [topcoder Arabic NER challenge](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30087004). Since I know nothing about Arabic, my model has surely surpassed me on that <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>.
