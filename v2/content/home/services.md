I aim to design **adaptive algorithms** for **Resource-Economical** mechine learning -- with a deeper understanding on the underlying mechanisms, algorithms can **self-adapt to heterogeneous scenarios**, which makes learning more automatic, robust, and thus Resource-Economical.

Three major directions of my research:
- Adapt algorithms to noisy and distant supervision -- alleviate the reliance on gold-standard labels.
- Allow models self-adapt to different problems/applications -- need less manual tuning.
- Automatically capture domain-specific knowledge -- adapt to different domains with less human endeavors.

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>

- Received more than **3,000 GitHub stars** in total. It is ranked 2,041 among all github users (according to [Gitstar](https://gitstar-ranking.com/LiyuanLucasLiu)). 
	- Although I doubt the Gitstar ranking is incomplete and outdated <i class="far fa-grin-squint-tears"></i>, it is still nice to have such an encouragement <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>.
- [Torch-Scope](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/Torch-Scope) has been downloaded by more than **[32,000 times](https://pepy.tech/project/torch-scope)**. 
	- Although this number cannot reflect the actual user number <i class="far fa-grin-squint-tears"></i>, there must be someone other than myself using this package <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>.
- Won the **[topcoder Arabic NER challenge](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30087004)**. 
	- Since I know nothing about Arabic, my model has surely surpassed me on that <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>. On second thought, why I am happy for being worse than PC... <i class="far fa-grin-squint-tears"></i>
- Love skiing (can do black runs, but still a rookie); [DJI](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DJI) fans (proudly own Mavic Pro, Mavic Mini & Spark); love to watch [Texas Hold'em](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Texas_hold_%27em) (but seldom play); play [Sheng Ji (双扣)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sheng_ji) and [Mafia (狼人杀)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Werewolf_(social_deduction_game)) with families & friends.
