My name is Liyuan LIU (刘力源 in Chinese). Feel free to call me Lucas. I am pursuing a [Ph.D. in Data Mining and Information Systems](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/) at UIUC, advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). I aim to design **adaptive algorithms** for **Resource-Economical mechine learning** -- with a deeper understanding on the underlying mechanisms, algorithms can **self-adapt to heterogeneous scenarios**, which makes learning more **automatic**, **robust**, and thus **resource-economical**.

Other things about me: Rookie Skier, [DJI](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DJI) Fans (proudly), [Sheng Ji (双扣)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sheng_ji) Fans, [Mafia (狼人杀)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Werewolf_(social_deduction_game)) Fans, and [Texas Hold'em](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Texas_hold_%27em) Fans.  

I am open to **collaborations** and **research internship** (summer 2020, 2021)

**If you are to visit UIUC, please let me buy you a coffee <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>**
