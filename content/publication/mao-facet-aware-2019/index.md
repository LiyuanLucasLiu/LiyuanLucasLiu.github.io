abstract: "Commonly adopted metrics for extractive text summarization like ROUGE focus on the lexical similarity and are facet-agnostic. In this paper, we present a facet-aware evaluation procedure for better assessment of the information coverage in extracted summaries while still supporting automatic evaluation once annotated. Specifically, we treat textitfacet instead of textittoken as the basic unit for evaluation, manually annotate the textitsupport sentences for each facet, and directly evaluate extractive methods by comparing the indices of extracted sentences with support sentences. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed setup by performing a thorough textitquantitative investigation on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, which in the meantime reveals useful insights of state-of-the-art summarization methods.footnotepÌŒhantomData can be found at url https://github.com/morningmoni/FAR."
