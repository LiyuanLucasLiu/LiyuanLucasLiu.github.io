Welcome to Lucas Liyuan Liu (刘力源)'s webpage! I am a Ph.D. student at [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/).
I received B.Eng. from [the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science. 
My undergraduate advisor is [Prof. Linli Xu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~linlixu/).

If you are going to visit UIUC, please let me buy you a bubble tea <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>. PS: [House Milk Teak](https://www.latealounge.com/home) and [Black Sugar Milk Teak (w. no additional sugar)](https://www.yelp.com/biz/teamoji-champaign) are pretty good.


<!-- I am open to collaborations and research internship (summer 2020, 2021)
 -->

<!-- My name is Liyuan LIU (刘力源 in Chinese). Feel free to call me Lucas. 
I am pursuing a [Ph.D. in Data Mining and Information Systems](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/) at UIUC, advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). 
I aim to design **adaptive algorithms** for **Resource-Economical mechine learning** -- with a deeper understanding on the underlying mechanisms, algorithms can **self-adapt to heterogeneous scenarios**, which makes learning more **automatic**, **robust**, and thus **resource-economical**.
