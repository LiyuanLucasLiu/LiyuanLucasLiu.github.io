I found lots of tools and apps and tricks quite useful. Most of them are really well-known. Still I tried to list all free ones I knew, just in case someone happens to ignore one or two in the past.  

* [Autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump): a cd commands that learns, extremely useful, everyone loves it after using

* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh): zsh configuration manager. Basically it helps you to decorate your terminal and makes it professional (looks like). I found the git plug-in quite useful

* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki): this tool is sooooo useful and well-known. Try it now if you haven't.

* [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/): I found it quite enjoyable to write code with sublime. Never forgot to install [package control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).

* [LatexTool](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools): a plug-in for sublime. YOu can install it from package control, write latex in sublime, support lots of features and configuration.

* [Sublime SFTP](https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp): sync file from desktop and server, very easy to use and extremely useful.

* [IPython](https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh): you can open an IPython notebook running on a remote computer. This trick is kind-of well-known, but still someone doesn't know it. Similar tricks can also be applied to iTorch.

* [jekyllrb](https://jekyllrb.com/): generating sites from markdown. I think the best choice to build up a blog is to use this tool and [Github page](https://pages.github.com/)

* [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/newsfeed/): managing pdfs and papers for you. It automatically sync and rename pdfs for you.

* [tqdm](https://github.com/noamraph/tqdm): a python package, which adds a progress meter to your loops in a second
