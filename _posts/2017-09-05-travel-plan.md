I would attend the EMNLP 2017 conference and present our Relation Extraction Paper (see below). Also I'm planning to write a EMNLP 2017 report later.

>Both human experts and public knowledge bases can provide (indirect, weak) supervision for information extraction (e.g., hand-crafted rules, distant supervision, etc.). How to leverage these heterogenous supervisions (on same set of instances) in a principled way? Our EMNLP 2017 paper with Liu Lucas Liyuan, Heng Ji, Jiawei Han formulates a joint objective to unify representation learning (on relation extraction) and truth finding (on labels).
