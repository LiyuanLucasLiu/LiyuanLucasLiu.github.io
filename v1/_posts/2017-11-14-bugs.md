# PyTorch

## LSTM

1. The LSTM takes ```[Seq_len * Batch_size * Hidden_size]``` as input, but embedding usually outputs ```[Batch_size * Seq_len * Hidden_size]```. Setting ```batch_fist = True```, but would be slower.

2. The output of LSTM is ```output, (h, c)```, where ```(h, c)``` is a tuple. So, we should use it as ```output, _ = self.word_lstm(x)```

## Error

1. many times, there would be raise ```Runtime Error``` and ```Device-side assert```, however, the place where such errors detected is usually not the lines it happened.
