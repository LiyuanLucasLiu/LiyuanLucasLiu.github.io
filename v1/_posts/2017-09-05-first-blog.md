As idea can only be generated from ideas, I finally set up this blog. 
Although it's almost my first time to try Git Page, it's supervisingly easy to use.
So I would encourage every one to share their thoughts through this cite.

For me, to be honest, I'm kind of dilatory... So... it's not likely that I would write a lot of stuff here, but still I would try my best.

I plan to write several kinds of stuff:
- My research
- Conference report &amp; reading notes
- Basic stuff &amp; tools
- Random things

Recently, I would try to find sometime and write something about my ICDM 15 paper.
Although it's kind of a old paper, I really likes it, and want to introduce it to more people.
Besides, I plan to write a EMNLP travel report after coming back.
